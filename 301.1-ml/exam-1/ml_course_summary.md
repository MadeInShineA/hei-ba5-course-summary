## Introduction to Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (A. Samuel). At its core:

- **Learning** means getting better at some given task
- **Machine learning** is about writing computer programs that get better at given tasks by using data

### Applications of ML
ML is everywhere in modern applications:
- Self-driving cars
- LLMs (Large Language Models)
- Intrusion detection
- Stock market prediction

### The ML Lifecycle

1. **Collect some data**
2. **Write a program that "learns" from it (training)**
3. **Use the program to "predict" what happens for new, unseen data**

### Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning from interaction with an environment

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we have labeled data consisting of training examples:
$$ \mathcal{D} = \{ (\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) | i = 1, \ldots, n \} $$

Our goal is to find a "model" $f$ that is able to predict $y$ for unseen values of $\mathbf{x}$.

**Notation:**
- Boldface is used to denote vectors
- $\mathbf{x}$ denotes a single training example, the associated response being denoted by $y$
- Individual components $\mathbf{x}_j$ denote single features of a given example
- Superscript denote different training examples: $\mathbf{x}^{(1)}, \mathbf{x}^{(2)}, \ldots$

### First Supervised Learning Algorithm: Linear Regression

A linear model is a model which, given some data point $x$ predicts the response $y$ using a linear function:
$$ \hat{y} = f(x) = a \cdot x + b $$

## Mathematical Foundations

### The Core Components of ML

**ML = Model space + Loss function (+ regularization) + optimization**

### Supervised Learning Setup

We have a (labeled) dataset of input-output examples:
$$ \mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) | i = 1, \ldots, n\} $$

And we want to find a model $f$ that, given an unseen data pair $(x, y)$, performs well at predicting $y$:
$$ f(x) \approx y $$

### Model Space and Parameters

To solve the problem of finding the best model and make the model search tractable, we restrict our search to a given model space $\mathcal{M}$. The learning task is then to find the best $f$ in $\mathcal{M}$.

In most cases, our models are parametrized by a finite set of parameters:
$$ \boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_p) \in \Theta $$
that belong to a parameter space $\Theta$.

### Examples of Model Spaces

#### Linear Regression Models
- **1D Linear regression model**: $\mathcal{M} = \{f(x) = a \cdot x + b | a, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$
- **Parameters**: $(a, b) =: \boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta := \mathbb{R}^2$
- **For a given parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (a, b)$**: $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(x) = a \cdot x + b$

#### Polynomial Regression Models
- **1D Polynomial Regression Model**: Model space is the set of all polynomial functions of $x$, up to degree $d$:
  $$ \mathcal{M} = \{f(x) = a_1 \cdot x + a_2 \cdot x^2 + \ldots + a_d \cdot x^d + b | a_1, \ldots, a_d, b \in \mathbb{R}\}$
- **Parameters**: $(b, a_1, \ldots, a_d) =: \boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta := \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$

### The Bias-Variance Trade-off

- **Simple models** (small $\mathcal{M}$): High bias (has difficulty fitting the data), low variance (low sensitivity to noise)
- **Complex models** (large $\mathcal{M}$): Low bias (can fit any data), high variance (too sensitive to data noise)

### Loss Functions

The idea is to quantify how "wrong" our predictions are. For each example $(\mathbf{x}, y)$ in the training dataset, we want to know how good our prediction $\hat{y} = f(x)$ is.

#### L2 Loss (Mean Squared Error)
$$ L(y, \hat{y}) = (y - \hat{y})^2 $$
- Penalizes large errors more than small ones
- Influenced by outliers
- Most common loss function for regression

#### L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error)
$$ L(y, \hat{y}) = |y - \hat{y}| $$
- More robust to outliers
- Less statistically well-behaved

### Empirical Risk Minimization

The central idea is to sum all losses $L(y^{(i)}, \hat{y}^{(i)})$ over the training dataset for each possible value of the parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$:

$$ J(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y^{(i)}, f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})) $$

This tells us how well the model $f_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ fits the data for a given $\boldsymbol{\theta}$.

The best model is the one with the smallest loss (smallest risk):
$$ \boldsymbol{\theta}^* = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta} J(\boldsymbol{\theta}) $$

### Optimization Methods

- Some models have analytical solutions (e.g., linear regression)
- In general, perform iterative minimization using methods like gradient descent
- Scipy provides optimization routines for general cases

## Model Evaluation

### Train-Validation-Test Split

The best practice in ML is to split the data into:
- **Training data** (60%): Used for model training
- **Validation data** (20%): Used for model selection
- **Test data** (20%): Used for final, honest performance evaluation

**Key principle**: Test data is never touched during model training and selection!

### Overfitting and Underfitting

#### Overfitting
- Model too complex
- Low training error
- High validation error
- Solution: Regularization, more data, simpler model

#### Underfitting
- Model too simple
- High training error
- High test error
- Solution: More complex model, more features

### Model Selection Process
1. Design different models
2. Train all models on the train set
3. Select best model by comparing performances on validation set

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff

- **Bias**: Error from wrong assumptions (underfitting)
- **Variance**: Error from sensitivity to training data (overfitting)
- **Sweet spot**: Minimize total error

### The No Free Lunch Theorem

"There is no such thing as a free lunch." (D. Wolpert and W. MacReady)

All models are wrong but some are useful. (G. Box)

### Regularization

Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to constrain model complexity:

$$ J_{\text{regularized}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = J_{\text{original}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \lambda \cdot R(\boldsymbol{\theta}) $$

Where:
- $J_{\text{original}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$: Original loss (e.g., MSE)
- $\lambda$: Regularization strength (hyperparameter)
- $R(\boldsymbol{\theta})$: Penalty term on parameters

#### L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression) and L1 Regularization (Lasso)

**L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):**
$$ J_{\text{Ridge}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} \theta_j^2 $$
- Penalizes squared magnitude of coefficients
- Shrinks coefficients toward zero (but not exactly zero)

**L1 Regularization (Lasso):**
$$ J_{\text{Lasso}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{p} |\theta_j| $$
- Penalizes absolute magnitude of coefficients
- Can shrink coefficients to exactly zero
- Performs a kind of automatic feature selection

### Residuals Analysis

Residuals are the part of the data that is not captured by the model:
$$ r_i := y_i - \hat{y}_i $$

In an ideal world, residuals should be i.i.d. Gaussian distributed.

**What to check in residuals:**
- Plot residuals vs target variable - is there structure?
- Is the variance of the residuals constant (homoscedasticity)?
- Are the residuals normally distributed (qq-plot)?
